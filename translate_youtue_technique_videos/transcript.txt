thank you moth for being a part of this
0:01
video and adding to this setup

0:12
nice
0:17
uh
0:31
what
0:36
[Music]

0:51
straight up these here are probably some
0:54
accessories you've never really heard of
0:56
most of these i've owned for a bit and
0:58
some of these i got them because i
0:59
needed them and so i decided to bring
1:01
them all together in order to showcase
1:03
12 desk setup accessories you've never
1:05
really heard of which makes my everyday
1:08
routine a lot better as i diversify my
1:10
everyday tech starting with the fact
1:12
that since i am a new apple watch owner
1:14
i needed something to keep my devices in
1:16
one place this here is a three-in-one
1:19
wireless charger with mac safe and since
1:21
i recently decided to start wearing an
1:23
apple watch i needed to have something
1:25
reliable that can take care of my
1:27
everyday carry items of course i went
1:29
black but they do sell a white version
1:31
if you wish to match your aesthetics
1:33
it's very well designed with a great
1:35
cable management material quality is
1:37
great with the silicon texture and i
1:39
enjoy the low profile it has it is quite
1:41
heavy but it feels extremely solid when
1:44
moving it around i do bring this back
1:46
and forth from the office to my bedroom
1:48
because of its design which makes it
1:49
super easy to toss it in a bag it is a
1:52
dust magnet sadly which i'm not too keen
1:54
on but for me the most important part is
1:57
functionality so it does have a power
1:59
output of 15 watts being able to fast
2:01
charge the new apple watch series 7.
2:04
both together it takes around 2 hours to
2:06
get a full charge on the iphone 13 pro
2:08
max and about an hour for the series 7.
2:11
the cool thing they did with this one is
2:12
that it of course flips up to deliver
2:14
nightstand mode and you can tweak the
2:16
selector tool in the back to match
2:18
pretty much any apple watch you
2:20
currently own by lifting its base
2:22
luckily in the middle we have an airpods
2:24
charging station supporting the latest
2:27
airpods pro airpods 2 and airpods 3. so
2:30
now do not buy this for the gen 1
2:32
airpods as it will not work just like
2:35
the fact that if you don't have an
2:36
iphone 13 or 12 you won't be getting
2:39
your money's worth with this dock and
2:41
don't worry as long as your case is
2:43
maxip compatible charging will work now
2:46
this case here is from moth if you are
2:48
interested i mainly rock it with a snap
2:51
on phone stand and wallet although for
2:53
me lately i've been able to bring my
2:55
workspace to a whole new level with
2:57
their smart desk mat this here is
2:59
literally preparing me for when i make
3:01
my full mac os transition for now it is
3:04
a place where i keep everything propped
3:06
up and organized whenever my balkan
3:08
charges lives at home this makes it
3:10
super easy for me to have access to a
3:12
max safe charger within my field of view
3:15
on top of that i can keep my apple watch
3:17
around if it's something that i wish to
3:19
get off my wrist with the cable
3:20
organizers it's great when it comes to
3:22
routing certain cables such as the
3:24
keyboard mouse chargers or even an ipad
3:27
charger if i feel like using one and the
3:29
whole set makes it easy to use its
3:31
tablet holder to bring a nice and cozy
3:33
workflow for when the ipad is needed
3:36
exactly why i'm very excited to get the
3:37
macbook pro 16 inch so i can use this
3:39
whole kit more efficiently a bit like a
3:42
board if you'd like simply a place where
3:44
i can prompt post-its attach my apple
3:46
pen leave my app at hanging to use it
3:49
with sidecar or if i'm on the go just
3:51
use the whole space as a laptop stand
3:53
but if you are someone that just rather
3:55
read this can definitely be of use to
3:57
you just like the fact that if you try
3:59
to set up nfc tags using the shortcuts
4:01
app these built-in nfc tags let you
4:03
activate custom settings or apps on your
4:06
phone by the way universal compatibility
4:08
is great if you did recently purchase
4:10
the new samsung galaxy phone so do know
4:13
that this comes with a snap phone
4:14
sticker living within a whole storage
4:16
set that will allow you to keep all of
4:18
your muffs snap on items organized love
4:20
the subtle details on this very well
4:22
done muff i also really love the fact
4:25
that i can throw a bunch of papers
4:26
within my set and have quick access to
4:28
them whenever i need to living on top we
4:31
have a new keyboard i am currently
4:32
trying it is a 75 low profile keyboard
4:35
that works with mac os and windows out
4:37
of the box which by the way the case
4:39
this came with is honestly really
4:41
impressive
4:42
it has a great design with microfiber
4:44
texture on some parts magnetic
4:45
attachments for the keyboard and it can
4:47
be used as a stand i wanted to include
4:50
this within my setup because soon enough
4:52
i will be rocking a maxed out macbook on
4:54
the desk the keycaps are no shine
4:56
through deliver a flat profile and rpbd
4:59
although you can install custom keycaps
5:01
like gmk ones underneath these you have
5:03
gator on low profile mechanical switches
5:06
which can be chosen thanks to the fact
5:08
that num 5 makes this keyboard with
5:10
three options i do love the build on
5:12
this since it has a lightweight aluminum
5:14
top frame some leds in the corners
5:16
tactile switches in the back for various
5:18
modes along a usbc port turning it
5:21
around we have a nice abs frame with a
5:23
metal plate and some rubber feet that
5:25
can be matched with these magnetic feet
5:27
to increase the incline making it easy
5:30
to type but do know that the experience
5:32
this delivers is very similar to a
5:34
laptop keyboard
5:36
the board itself has awesome features
5:38
such as leds on the top frame where the
5:41
left led turns light blue when the caps
5:43
lock is enabled or blue when it is
5:45
connected to one of the four bluetooth
5:47
devices on the other hand the right led
5:49
is a battery indicator which i think is
5:51
pretty awesome due to the nature of the
5:53
keycaps and how wide they are
5:55
backlighting on this is not as good
5:57
though plus the back plate isn't very
6:00
reflective so any of the 21 different
6:02
rgb effects this delivers won't be as
6:04
strong as you might wish but because i
6:06
do still enjoy using the rgb features to
6:09
avoid wasting battery i'd rather connect
6:11
it to my computer via usb-c to save
6:13
battery of course not any usb-c because
6:16
i finally got a custom coiled pilot
6:18
usb-c cable orange was the color i went
6:21
for to match my aesthetics the cable
6:23
itself is a mix of woven mesh and pet
6:25
mesh has a type c metal plug and a
6:28
detachable metal canon pilot connector
6:30
the wire is protected by this clear
6:32
plastic which is super nice and is
6:34
overall about 1.2 meters long all of
6:37
this rests on this wool mat made by
6:39
delta hub and no matter what for tables
6:41
like these i personally rather have wool
6:43
mats to protect them the cool thing
6:45
about this one unlike the groovemate
6:47
ones is that it has rubber feet to
6:49
prevent it from sliding it is way
6:51
shorter than the groove made wool mat
6:53
but honestly i like the length i don't
6:55
find myself running out of room even
6:57
when i have all of these items on it
7:00
plus it makes my carpool wrist rest a
7:02
lot easier to slide with so much deck in
7:04
one place at night i often need light to
7:07
be able to see what's going on this here
7:09
is a 60 canadian light bar made by
7:12
quintus and it has absolutely been a
7:14
game changer for me while it saves you
7:16
tons of money from going with a more
7:18
premium one like the benq this here is
7:21
able to deliver the same functionality
7:23
the controls on it are touch which is a
7:25
super nice addition to the bar its
7:27
features power auto dimming control
7:29
temperatures and brightness it measures
7:32
around 20 inches long enough to cover
7:34
something like my 38 inch ultra wide
7:36
monitor as for the clap no need to worry
7:39
it fits on most monitors even on this
7:41
ultra wide display once it's on monitors
7:44
it easily delivers an asymmetric light
7:46
pattern to reduce glare on the screen
7:48
plus honestly it really helps when it
7:50
comes to filming back on the setup it
7:52
shines light extremely well and makes
7:54
things like the evo 4 look awesome this
7:57
here is my favorite audio interface ever
7:59
and it works so well when gaming i
8:02
recently started to get into valorent
8:04
and this thing just delivers it allows
8:06
me to plug in my sure mic to communicate
8:08
with the team along with my audio
8:10
technica headphones to listen to
8:11
footsteps it not only looks good but it
8:14
also has great functionality it's super
8:16
easy to interact with because the middle
8:18
dial controls everything if you want to
8:21
control the gain of either of your
8:22
microphone inputs you simply press the
8:24
input that you want and rotate the dial
8:27
although the coolest feature is the fact
8:28
that you can control the mix between
8:30
your own microphone audio and your
8:32
in-game audio all by pressing the mix
8:34
button and rotating the dial to either
8:36
side to accomplish 100 mic input or 100
8:40
in-game audio so you can control your
8:42
voice reference and mix it with the game
8:44
the green button delivers a smart game
8:46
function in case you automatically wish
8:49
to calibrate your output of decibels
8:51
when talking to the mic for reference
8:53
the best thing you can do is set your
8:55
mic volume between -12 and -9 decibels i
8:59
know it's so weird having minuses when
9:01
it comes to volume which is completely
9:03
different to lighting when i need more
9:05
light i love using my gantry light
9:07
slider to control its output this here
9:10
is the aim table light and i love it my
9:13
only issue with it is that it makes me
9:15
want to get rid of the aura lamp which i
9:17
literally just bought mainly because
9:19
this thing delivers directional light
9:21
when needed yeah i know it's pretty
9:24
awesome on top of that it matches the
9:26
industrial theme i'm trying to go for
9:28
and it just looks good regardless of the
9:30
setting you choose although i do wish
9:32
this particular model was philips u
9:33
compatible a lot of their lights are and
9:36
it's super easy to shop for those who
9:38
deliver smart home capabilities it would
9:40
have been great being able to add it to
9:42
our google home hub yeah ever since i
9:45
got this google nest audio i fell in
9:47
love with automation i now get in the
9:49
office and turn a bunch of cool tech on
9:51
turn lights on
9:54
so i added the hub to keep enhancing our
9:56
automation around the office the device
9:59
itself looks great has a mute button and
10:01
a volume button around the side and an
10:03
ambient eq light sensor on the front it
10:06
serves me as a clock a weather checker
10:08
delivers some cool news but most
10:10
importantly of course my automation as
10:12
you can see i have over 20 devices
10:14
connected to it including our august
10:16
door lock the only thing missing here is
10:18
my tv which i still yet have to figure
10:21
out how to connect it i do like casting
10:23
some youtube videos on it and podcasts
10:25
to have it in the background as i work
10:27
and the cool thing is that the imagery
10:29
actually plays on the screen you can do
10:31
this with disney netflix spotify and
10:34
more and if you happen to have more
10:36
speakers around the office well you can
10:38
change them all to output volume
10:40
honestly with time i will be building a
10:42
whole automation workflow that will be
10:43
integrated into my condo a full video
10:46
will come right after i make more room
10:48
on my computer for all these videos you
10:51
see one whole video project can take
10:53
about 70 gigabytes of storage and
10:55
sometimes i need to have the latest
10:57
projects with me at all times and so
10:59
corsair were kind enough to send me
11:01
their latest m.2 module it comes with a
11:04
heatsink which is great for a custom pc
11:06
but i needed to pair it up with my asus
11:08
arian aluminum casing this here attaches
11:11
to my keys and i can carry it around
11:13
with me at all times i get these super
11:15
fast read and write speeds thanks to
11:17
corsair and half 2 terabytes at my
11:18
disposal at all times enough to have at
11:21
least a couple of months worth of video
11:23
i very much suggest you get an m.2 drive
11:26
and a casing to work on projects super
11:28
quickly and straight from the module
11:30
super awesome and works great with the
11:32
macbook however when i'm not on the go
11:34
this here is literally the best desk
11:36
setup accessory on this desk my kingston
11:39
workflow station saves me a ton of
11:41
headaches and time when it comes to
11:43
importing projects from all kinds of
11:44
media devices it's a modular 4-bay dock
11:47
where you can buy these optional
11:49
workflow readers i've got three of them
11:51
where they overall allow me to plug my
11:53
sd cards mini sd cards and a usb-c with
11:56
a usb-a drive the build quality is
11:58
nothing fancy it does feel a bit cheap
12:00
but i like it it has rubber feet to
12:03
prevent this thing from sliding i
12:05
literally use it all the time so i feel
12:07
like without the feet it would be
12:08
annoying the coolest thing is the high
12:10
speed data transfers it delivers which i
12:12
pretty much need i filmed 4k h.264 slot
12:16
10 bit 422 footage and those are massive
12:19
meaning that the unit connects to the pc
12:22
via usbc 3.2 love this little powerful
12:25
thing and for now i wouldn't trade it
12:27
for anything else i'm most certain 80 of
12:30
these accessories you've probably never
12:32
heard of most of these i've been using
12:34
for a long time and some of them i
12:36
recently just bought let me know in the
12:38
comments section which accessory you
12:39
think might be most worth it for you if
12:42
the video was helpful enough smash the
12:43
like button and subscribe to the channel
12:45
i will see you all soon take care
12:49
[Music]
12:57
you
