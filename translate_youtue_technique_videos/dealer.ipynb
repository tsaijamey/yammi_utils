       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">layers. So the first one is just the input layers.dot.input, and we need to specify the shape of the input. </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Remember, we don\\'t need to specify the batch number or how many examples. Three by one, again it\\'s three because </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">Now that we\\'ve specified the input layer, we\\'re ready to do an lstm layer. So we will do layers.dot.lstm and </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">capitals, and this number is relatively arbitrary. But we will choose 64, which is a relatively big (but not super </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">32. We\\'re not going to mess with the activation functions for the LSTM, but for the dense layers, it\\'s usually a </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">good idea to set activation equal to relu, so we will do that for both of those dense layers. Now we must specify </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">the output of our model, and since we are only forecasting one variable (we\\'re just trying to predict say the next</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">default it\\'s linear, which is desired. We can now close this up and specify that the model is going to be </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">compiled. To compile the model, we must set the loss function, and the loss function we want to minimize is the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">mean squared error (MSE), so we will just write the string of mse for mean squared error. We also need to specify </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">the optimizer, so we will set the optimizer equal to the Adam optimizer, where we specify that the learning rate is</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">different problem, the learning rate is something you definitely want to play around with, as well as these values </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">here. We also want to specify a new metric, which is going to be metrics equals, we need to put it in a list, the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">mean absolute error (MAE). This number tells us on average how much we\\'re off by, rather than the squared </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">distance. We\\'d rather look at this, although we need to minimize the MSE as this is not differentiable. We\\'re now</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">ready to fit the model, so we can do model.fit. We pass our inputs of x_train and y_train, and then we specify that</span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">point, it looks like it\\'s not really changed very much, so we can actually cancel this, and it is going to save </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">run, we simply get the training predictions with model.predict on x_train, and then we have to do a flatten. Then </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">we can do a plot of dates_train and the train_predictions and dates_train and y_train. That\\'s that blue and the </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">orange curve, and then we just create the legend. Since I explained that code for the train, I feel no real need to</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">explain it much for the validation, as this is literally the same thing, but replacing the word \"train\" with \"val\".</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">So for the validation, we get this graph. Or, it follows it until you know about 2017, and then it just really </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">flattens off, which is the same time when it actually starts to pick up. So the observations, what really happened,</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">is it went up like this, but the predictions, it actually just started to zone off and it couldn\\'t follow it </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">anymore. If we were to look at the test, this is again just replacing that word \"train\" with \"test\". This picture </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">is even worse; it doesn\\'t follow it at all. It actually thinks it\\'s going down a little bit, whereas it\\'s going </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">up a lot, and then it goes down. I\\'m now going to put all three of those pictures on the same graph. Again, the </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">然后我们要一直到，但不包括，最后一个。 所以，1：-1表示这里的所有这些行，这就是冒号的作用。 </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我之所以这样做，是因为我们有机会接触到这个。 最后一块只是在这里必须是1，因为技术上我们只使用一个变量。 </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">。 我们必须把2，3，或4作为这个数字。 我们只是在做1，因为我们在做单变量预测。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">现在，幸运的是，从这里开始，这个功能是非常容易的。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们可以直接得到我们的输出向量y等于df.as_matrix()，同样我们想要所有的行，但我们只想要最后一列。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们可以只做返回日期，X，Y。 只是如果你继续往下走，会有一个小小的困难。 </span>\n",

       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">pe(np.float32)，你会修复一个奇怪的错误，你以后会发现。 现在，为了调用这个函数，我们又需要这三样东西。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们将得到日期，x，y，并将其设置为windowed_df_to_date_x_y，就是我们的函数。 我们将传入之前的window_df。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">这三样东西应该是numpy数组，所以我们会得到dates.shape、x.shape和y.shape，看到这三样东西各有9079个，我们</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">的输入矩阵，然后是3x1，因为我们要看三步，但只针对一种类型的变量。 现在，我们要把数据分成训练区、验证区和测试区。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">训练将训练模型，验证将帮助训练模型，然后测试是我们要用来真正评估模型的性能。 我们需要两个整数来帮助进行分割。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们先得到q80，这将是日期长度的整数乘以0.8。 然后我们会得到q90，它等于日期长度的int乘以0.9。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">因此，我们将把培训分区作为前80%。 因此，我们会得到日期火车、X火车和Y火车。 每一个人都要成为他们的每一件作品。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">因此，这将是日期，但然后只到q80，使其成为前80％。 我们将对x做同样的事情，所以x一直到q80，然后y一直到q80。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">因为它有点慢，我只是要粘贴这两行，通过日期q80到q90，然后x q80到q90，以及y q80到q90，得到val、dates、val </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">x、file和y大约。 这就是80和90件之间的所有信息。 然后我们就通过说q90往后的测试信息来获得最后的10%。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">所以你可以看到它是有顺序的：第一块训练是到前百分之八十，验证是百分之八十到九十（10%），然后测试是九十以后的最后百分</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">之十。 我们可以用matplotlib很好地将其可视化和着色，所以我们将做plt.plot。 然后我们要去买枣子车，再去买Y车。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们将对val做同样的处理，所以日期下划线val和y val。 最后，对test、plt.plot dates test和y test也是如此。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们将添加一个图例，这样你就可以看到哪个是哪个。 虽然这应该是很明显的。 Plt.legend训练，然后是验证，然后是测试。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">如果你绘制这个图，你会看到火车是这里所有的信息，由蓝色标记，然后验证是这一块，然后测试是这里这一块。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">现在是创建和训练我们的模型的时候了。 我们可以从tensorflow做一些导入：从tensorflow.comstep模型中获取顺序。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们要从tensorflow.curious.optimizers中建立一个顺序模型，我们会得到atom。 这就是我们要使用的优化器。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">然后从tensorflow.kira的导入层。 我们将制作一个有顺序的、由许多层组成的模型。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">所以我们将定义我们的模型，我们将称它为模型等于顺序，然后我们将传递给它一个层的列表。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">所以第一个只是输入层.点.输入，我们需要指定输入的形状。 记住，我们不需要指定批号或多少个例子。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">三乘以一，又是三，因为我们在做过去三天的工作，那是一，因为我们只需要一个功能，只需要单变量预测。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">现在我们已经指定了输入层，我们准备做一个lstm层。 因此，我们将做layer.dot.lstm和capitals，而这个数字是相对随意的。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">但我们将选择64个，这对LSTM来说是一个相对较大（但不是超级大）的神经元数量。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">关于这个数字，你真正需要知道的是，这个数字越大，模型就越复杂，越容易过度拟合，而且被认为是越重的。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们将添加一个密集层（layer.dense），而不是LSTM。 我们将选择32，理由与上述类似。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们也非常欢迎你把密集层堆积起来，所以我们就把这个再贴上，再来个32。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们不打算弄乱LSTM的激活函数，但对于密集层，通常是一个好主意，设置激活等于relu，所以我们将为这两个密集层做这个。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">现在我们必须指定我们模型的输出，由于我们只预测一个变量（我们只是想预测说下一个值），我们只希望这是一的层.密，在这里</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们不改变激活函数，因为默认情况下它是线性的，这是所希望的。 我们现在可以关闭这个，并指定模型要被编译。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">为了编译模型，我们必须设置损失函数，而我们想要最小化的损失函数是平均平方误差（MSE），所以我们只需写出平均平方误差的</span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">串mse。 我们还需要指定优化器，所以我们将设置优化器等于亚当优化器，其中我们指定学习率等于0.001。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">事实证明，在这个例子中，0.001的效果很好，但如果你在做一个不同的问题，学习率是你肯定要玩的东西，还有这里的这些值。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们还想指定一个新的度量，这将是度量的等值，我们需要把它放在一个列表中，平均绝对误差（MAE）。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">这个数字告诉我们平均偏差多少，而不是距离的平方。 我们宁愿看这个，虽然我们需要最小化MSE，因为这不是可分的。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们现在准备拟合模型，所以我们可以做model.fit。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们传递x_train和y_train的输入，然后我们指定验证数据等于x_val和y_val的元组。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们要让它运行100个epochs，也就是在数据集上运行100次。 我将按下回车键，我们可以看看会发生什么。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">我们可以看到，在这一点上，它看起来并没有真正改变多少，所以我们实际上可以取消这个，它将保存到目前为止的任何进展。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">现在，简单分析一下，我们主要关心的是验证的平均绝对误差会下降。 我们可以看到它一开始是14，然后是11、10、9。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">然后它在8、9、10左右徘徊，这时我准备停止它，因为它并没有真正改变那么多。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">用图表来直观地了解情况要容易得多，所以在担心代码之前，我只想给你看看我们可以为它在训练集上预测的漂亮图片。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">因此，橙色是实际观察到的数据；这是从1986年到2016年真实发生的情况。 蓝色是我们预测的。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">因此，每次它都能得到之前的三个，并试图预测下一个。 这也是它被训练的内容。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">为了使其运行，我们只需在x_train上用model.predict获得训练预测，然后我们必须做一个flatten。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">然后我们可以做一个dates_train和train_predictions以及dates_train和y_train的图。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">这就是那个蓝色和橙色的曲线，然后我们就创建图例。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">既然我解释了火车的代码，我觉得没有必要对验证进行过多的解释，因为这实际上是同样的事情，只是把 \"火车 \"这个词换成了 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">\"val\"。 所以为了验证，我们得到了这个图。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">或者说，它一直跟着它，直到你知道2017年，然后它就真的变平了，这也是它真正开始回升的时间。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">因此，观察结果，真正发生的是它像这样上升，但预测，它实际上只是开始分区，它不能再跟随它。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">如果我们看一下测试，这又只是把 \"训练 \"这个词替换成 \"测试\"。 这张照片更糟糕，它完全没有遵循它。 </span>\n",
       "<span style=\"color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000\">它实际上认为它正在下降一点，而它却上升了很多，然后它又下降了。 我现在要把这三张图片放在同一个图上。 同样，代码 '</span>\n",
